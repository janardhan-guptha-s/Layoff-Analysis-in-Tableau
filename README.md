# Layoff-Analysis-in-Tableau

### Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive Layoff Analysis conducted as part of the IFT 598: Data Visualization & Reporting course. The visualization highlights trends in layoffs across various companies and industries, correlating the amount of financial investment and the percentage of workforce reductions over time. The analysis includes global and U.S.-specific data, offering insights into how economic conditions, market pressures, and raised funds have affected employment levels, especially in tech and large corporations.

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, data-driven perspective on layoffs, helping stakeholders understand patterns and contributing factors such as funding and business restructuring efforts.
